# Predicting-Customer-Churn
Predicting customer churn for a telecom company and making business recommendations on how to lower customer churn.

I analyzed a telecom company's customer data to predict churn and provide business recommendations. I implemented a Logistic Regression model, a K-Nearest Neighbors model, and a Random Forest Model and used 5-fold cross validation and compared performance metrics for each model in predicting customer churn. Then, I identified three features that most strongly predicted customer churn and suggested two specific actions the telecom company could take to reduce churn.
